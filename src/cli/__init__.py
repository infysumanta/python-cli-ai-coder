"""
Command-line interface package for the Python CLI AI Coder.

This package contains the CLI implementation for the project generator,
providing a rich, interactive interface for users to specify project
requirements and visualize the generation process.

The CLI uses the Rich library to create a visually appealing interface
with features such as:
- Colorful text and formatting
- Progress bars and spinners
- Tables and panels
- Interactive prompts

The main entry point for the CLI is the `main()` function in the `main` module.
